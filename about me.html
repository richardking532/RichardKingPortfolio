									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>Welcome! My name is Richard, and I am currently serving in the United States Marine Corps as a Ground Supply Officer. 
										I will be separating from the service in May 2024 and am looking for positions as a data analyst.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Professional Experience</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\Headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										My journey began at the United States Air Force Academy, where I graduated with a B.S. in Military Strategic Studies. Instead of 
										pursuing a traditional career route in the Air Force, I opted to cross-commission into the Marine Corps, where I was selected
										to be a Ground Supply Officer. During my 4+ years of service, I have completed two deployments and served in a wide variety of positions
										ranging from being a financial analyst, managing a customer service department, acting as a contracting specialist, and serving 
										as the assistant manager for a company with over 200 personnel. All of these were in addition to my primary military specialty as a 
										supply chain operations manager!
									</p>

									<p>When deciding what I wanted to do when I get out of the Marine Corps, I reflected on what parts of each job I felt most passionate about.
										What I realized was that although I never worked in a "traditional" data analyst role, I have applied the tools and mindset of a data analyst
										to every position that I have had over the years. Whether building dashboards or creating reports, I found that
										tackling problems using a data-driven approach allowed me to deliver new insights to senior leaders and adjacent departments and to 
										automate processes to increase my own productivity along with the productivity of the teams I have worked with.
									</p>							

									<p>My experiences allowed me to develop strong proficiency using programs such as Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and SharePoint. Though not an 
										expert, between college and my career I have also had the opportunity to become familiar with other programs to include Microsoft Access,
										MATLAB, and VBScript. Since deciding I want to become a data analyst, I have spent the past year expanding my skillset by teaching myself
										 R and SQL, and I plan to study Python before I get out of the military as well.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Personal Life</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Zula.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										When not at work, I can most likely be found spending time in nature with my wife and dog. I also enjoy cooking, gardening, woodworking, and 
										reading. I consider myself to be a lifelong learner and avid DIYer. My major project right now is renovating a historic home my wife and I
										inherited in Jackson, GA.
